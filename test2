The Kalki avatara, the final avatar of Vishnu,
 is described as a powerful force that will purge the world of evil.
 He is prophesized to defend the pious and eliminate the wicked, the mlecchas (barbarians),
 the heretics, the thieves, the atheists,
 and the impious with his sword and his seven divine powers.
